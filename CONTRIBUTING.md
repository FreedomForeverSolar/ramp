## Code of Conduct

We expect all contributors to be respectful and constructive in their interactions with the community. Please be kind and courteous in discussions, issues, and pull requests.

## Getting Started

### Reporting Bugs

If you find a bug, please create an issue on GitHub with:

- A clear, descriptive title
- Steps to reproduce the issue
- Expected behavior
- Actual behavior
- Your environment (OS, Go version, Ramp version)
- Any relevant logs or error messages

### Suggesting Features

Feature suggestions are welcome! Please create an issue with:

- A clear description of the feature
- The problem it solves
- Example use cases
- Any potential implementation ideas

## Development Setup

### Prerequisites

- Go 1.24.5 or later
- Git
- Basic familiarity with git worktrees (helpful but not required)

### Setting Up Your Development Environment

1. **Fork the repository** on GitHub

2. **Clone your fork**:
   ```bash
   git clone git@github.com:YOUR-USERNAME/ramp.git
   cd ramp
   ```

3. **Add upstream remote**:
   ```bash
   git remote add upstream git@github.com:FreedomForeverSolar/ramp.git
   ```

4. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   go mod download
   ```

5. **Build the project**:
   ```bash
   go build -o ramp .
   ```

6. **Run tests**:
   ```bash
   go test ./...
   ```

### Running Ramp Locally

You can run your local development version without installing:

```bash
go run . --help
```

Or build and install to test the full installation:

```bash
./install.sh
```

## How to Contribute

### Finding Issues to Work On

- Check the [issue tracker](https://github.com/FreedomForeverSolar/ramp/issues) for open issues
- Issues labeled `good first issue` are great for new contributors
- Issues labeled `help wanted` are ready to be worked on

### Creating a Branch

Create a feature branch from `main`:

```bash
git checkout main
git pull upstream main
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
```

Use descriptive branch names:
- `feature/add-interactive-mode` for new features
- `fix/worktree-creation-error` for bug fixes
- `docs/update-readme` for documentation changes

## Coding Standards

### General Guidelines

- **Write small, composable functions**: Keep functions focused and under 40 lines of code when possible
- **Use descriptive names**: Variable and function names should clearly indicate their purpose
- **Add comments**: Explain complex logic and the "why" behind decisions
- **Follow Go conventions**: Use `gofmt` and `golint` to ensure code style consistency

### Go-Specific Standards

- Run `go fmt` before committing
- Use meaningful error messages
- Avoid global variables
- Keep packages focused on a single responsibility
- Document exported functions with comments

### Project Structure

The project follows this structure:

```
cmd/           - CLI command definitions (using Cobra)
internal/      - Internal packages (config, git, ports, ui)
  config/      - Configuration file parsing
  git/         - Git operations and worktree management
  ports/       - Port allocation management
  ui/          - User interface and progress feedback
```

When adding new functionality:
- Add new commands to `cmd/`
- Add supporting logic to appropriate `internal/` packages
- Keep business logic out of CLI command handlers

## Documentation

### Documentation Structure

Ramp uses a docs-as-code approach with the following structure:

```
docs/
├── index.md                    # Documentation home
├── getting-started.md          # Quick start guide
├── configuration.md            # Configuration reference
├── installation.md             # Installation guide
├── commands/                   # Auto-generated command docs
│   ├── ramp.md
│   ├── ramp-up.md
│   └── ...
├── guides/                     # How-to guides
│   ├── microservices.md
│   ├── frontend-backend.md
│   └── custom-scripts.md
└── advanced/                   # Advanced topics
    ├── port-management.md
    ├── worktrees.md
    └── troubleshooting.md
```

### Updating Documentation

**Command Documentation** (auto-generated):
- Command docs in `docs/commands/` are auto-generated from Cobra command definitions
- After modifying command descriptions, flags, or help text in `cmd/`, run:
  ```bash
  make docs
  # Or: go run scripts/gen-docs.go
  ```
- Commit the generated changes with your PR
- CI will verify docs are up-to-date

**Manual Documentation**:
- Update guides in `docs/guides/` when adding new features or patterns
- Update `docs/configuration.md` when changing config schema
- Update `docs/troubleshooting.md` when fixing common issues
- Keep `README.md` concise - move detailed content to `docs/`

### Testing Documentation Locally

Verify docs are up-to-date:
```bash
make docs-verify
```

This will fail if command documentation is out of sync with code.

## Testing

### Running Tests

Run all tests:
```bash
make test
# Or: go test ./...
```

Run tests with verbose output:
```bash
go test -v ./...
```

Run tests with coverage:
```bash
make test-coverage
# Opens coverage.html in browser
```

Run tests for a specific package:
```bash
go test ./internal/config
```

### Writing Tests

- Add tests for new functionality
- Add tests to reproduce bugs before fixing them
- Use table-driven tests for multiple similar test cases
- Test both success and error cases
- Mock external dependencies (git commands, file system operations)

Example test structure:

```go
func TestFunctionName(t *testing.T) {
    tests := []struct {
        name    string
        input   string
        want    string
        wantErr bool
    }{
        {
            name:    "valid input",
            input:   "test",
            want:    "expected",
            wantErr: false,
        },
        // More test cases...
    }

    for _, tt := range tests {
        t.Run(tt.name, func(t *testing.T) {
            got, err := FunctionName(tt.input)
            if (err != nil) != tt.wantErr {
                t.Errorf("FunctionName() error = %v, wantErr %v", err, tt.wantErr)
                return
            }
            if got != tt.want {
                t.Errorf("FunctionName() = %v, want %v", got, tt.want)
            }
        })
    }
}
```

## Pull Request Process

   git fetch upstream
   git rebase upstream/main
   ```

2. **Run tests** and ensure they pass:
   ```bash
   make test
   ```

3. **Run formatting**:
   ```bash
   go fmt ./...
   ```

4. **Update documentation** if you changed commands:
   ```bash
   make docs
   git add docs/commands/
   ```

5. **Verify docs are up-to-date**:
   ```bash
   make docs-verify
   ```

6. **Build the project** to ensure it compiles:
   ```bash
   make build
   ```

### Submitting Your Pull Request

     - Any breaking changes or migration notes
   - Link to any related issues using `Fixes #123` or `Closes #123`

3. Wait for review and address any feedback

### Pull Request Guidelines

- Keep PRs focused on a single feature or fix
- Break large changes into smaller, reviewable PRs when possible
- **Update documentation**:
  - Run `make docs` if you changed command definitions
  - Update relevant guides in `docs/` for new features
  - Update `docs/configuration.md` for config changes
- Add or update tests for your changes
- Ensure CI checks pass (including docs verification)

# Getting Started

This guide will walk you through creating your first Ramp project and understanding the basic workflow.

## Your First Ramp Project

### Option 1: Try the Demo

The fastest way to understand Ramp is to run the included demo:

```bash
cd demo/demo-microservices-app
ramp install                # Clone demo repositories
ramp up my-feature          # Create feature branch across all repos
ramp run dev                # Start simulated development environment
ramp status                 # View project status
ramp down my-feature        # Clean up feature
```

See [demo/demo-microservices-app/README.md](../demo/demo-microservices-app/README.md) for a detailed walkthrough.

### Option 2: Create Your Own Project

#### 1. Initialize a New Project

```bash
mkdir my-project && cd my-project
ramp init
```

The interactive setup will guide you through:

- **Project name** - Defaults to directory name
- **Branch prefix** - Defaults to "feature/" (e.g., `feature/my-branch`)
- **Repository URLs** - Add as many as needed (GitHub, GitLab, etc.)
- **Setup/cleanup scripts** - Optional automation hooks
- **Port management** - Optional unique port per feature
- **Custom commands** - Like 'doctor' for environment checks

#### 2. Customize Your Scripts

Edit the generated files in `.ramp/scripts/`:

```bash
# .ramp/scripts/setup.sh - Runs after 'ramp up'
# Install dependencies, start databases, etc.

# .ramp/scripts/cleanup.sh - Runs before 'ramp down'
# Stop services, clean up temp files, etc.

# .ramp/scripts/doctor.sh - Environment validation
# Check for required tools, dependencies, etc.
```

All scripts receive environment variables for paths, ports, and repository locations. See [Custom Scripts Guide](guides/custom-scripts.md) for details.

#### 3. Install Repositories

```bash
ramp install  # Clone all configured repositories
```

This happens automatically if you selected "Yes" during `ramp init`.

## Basic Workflow

### Creating a Feature

```bash
ramp up my-feature
```

This command:
- Creates `feature/my-feature` branch in all repositories
- Sets up git worktrees in `trees/my-feature/`
- Allocates a unique port number
- Runs your setup script

### Working on Your Feature

Your feature workspace is in `trees/my-feature/`:

```
trees/my-feature/
├── frontend/     # Worktree for frontend repo
└── api/          # Worktree for api repo
```

Make changes across repositories as needed. Each worktree is a fully functional git repository.

### Checking Status

```bash
ramp status
```

Shows:
- Current branch and sync status for each repository
- Active features and their worktrees
- Port allocations
- Uncommitted changes

### Running Custom Commands

```bash
ramp run dev           # Auto-detect current feature
ramp run dev my-feature  # Specify feature explicitly
```

Custom commands are defined in your `ramp.yaml` configuration.

### Cleaning Up

When your feature is complete and merged:

```bash
ramp down my-feature
```

This command:
- Runs cleanup script
- Removes git worktrees
- Deletes local branches
- Releases port allocation
- Removes feature directory

### Batch Cleanup

After merging multiple features:

```bash
ramp prune
```

This identifies all merged features and removes them after confirmation.

## Understanding the Directory Structure

```
my-project/
├── .gitignore                   # Auto-generated by ramp init
├── .ramp/
│   ├── ramp.yaml                # Configuration
│   ├── local.yaml               # Local preferences (gitignored)
│   ├── port_allocations.json    # Auto-generated (gitignored)
│   └── scripts/
│       ├── setup.sh
│       ├── cleanup.sh
│       └── dev.sh
├── repos/                       # Source repositories (gitignored)
│   ├── frontend/
│   └── api/
└── trees/                       # Feature worktrees (gitignored)
    ├── my-feature/
    │   ├── frontend/
    │   └── api/
    └── other-feature/
        ├── frontend/
        └── api/
```

### Key Directories

- **repos/** - Your main repository clones (don't modify directly, gitignored)
- **trees/** - Feature-specific worktrees (this is where you work, gitignored)
- **.ramp/** - Configuration and scripts
- **.gitignore** - Auto-generated to exclude ramp-managed files

## Common Patterns

### Creating a Feature from an Existing Branch

```bash
ramp up new-feature --target existing-feature
ramp up new-feature --target origin/main
```

### Using Custom Branch Prefixes

```bash
ramp up urgent-fix --prefix hotfix/
# Creates: hotfix/urgent-fix
```

### Verbose Mode for Debugging

```bash
ramp -v up my-feature
ramp -v status
```
